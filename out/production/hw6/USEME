Script Commands:

- all commands are case-insensitive


- to run any image transformation, there MUST be an image already loaded in to the layer


- an image must be set to current to perform operations on it


- to set a layer as the current layer, the user must type "current" followed by the name of the
  layer they wish to select as current.
    - e.g. to set the layer called "first" (assuming it has been created) as the current layer, the
      user would have to type "current first".


- to save a file, type "save" followed by the desired file path as a String and the type
  of the file you are saving to (PPM, JPG, PNG). All inputs except the file are case insensitive.
    - e.g. to save an image to Koala.ppm, type "save Koala.ppm PPM"


- to load a file, type "load" followed by the file path as a String
    - e.g. to load a ppm image of a koala, type "load Koala.ppm"


- to blur the current layer, type "blur"


- to sharpen the current layer, type "sharpen"


- to transform the current layer to sepia, type "sepia"


- to transform the current layer to greyscale, type "greyscale"


- to set the current layer to visible, the user must type "visible" followed by nothing else


- to set the current layer to invisible, the user must type "invisible" followed by nothing else


- to add a layer to the list of layers, type in "add" followed by the name of the layer ("first", "
  second", "tree", etc)
    - e.g. to create a layer called "first" and subsequently another one called
      "second", type in "add first", then "add second"

- to load many layers, the user must input "loadmany" followed by the text file that contains all
  the file locations of the files they want to load


- to save many layers, the user must imput the word "export" followed by the text file where they
  want to save the layers


- in terms of removing layers, the user can only remove the layer that has been specified as "
  current". To do this, the user must type in "remove" with nothing else following. If the current
  layer is an empty Optional, this command does nothing.
    - e.g. to remove the current layer (which is called "first"), the user would just type "remove"


- to quit the program, the user must type either "q" or "quit", both of which are case-insensitive.
