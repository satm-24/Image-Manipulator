Script Commands:
- all commands are case-insensitive

- to set a layer as the current layer, the user must type "current" followed by
  the name of the layer they wish to select as current.
   - e.g. to set the layer called "first" (assuming it has been created) as the current
  layer, the user would have to type "current first".
     

- to save a file, type "save" followed by the desired file path as a String
    - e.g. to save an image to Koala.ppm, type "save Koala.ppm"
  

- to load a file, type "load" followed by the file path as a String
    - e.g. to load a ppm image of a koala, type "load Koala.ppm"
  

- to blur the current layer, type "blur"
  

- to sharpen the current layer, type "sharpen"  
  

- to transform the current layer to sepia, type "sepia"
  

- to transform the current layer to greyscale, type "greyscale"  
  

- to add a layer to the list of layers, type in "create layer" followed by 
the name of the layer ("first", "second", "tree", etc/)
    - e.g. to create a layer called "first" and subsequently another one called
  "second", type in "create layer first", then "create layer second"  
      
      
- in terms of removing layers, the user can only remove the layer that has been 
  specified as "current". To do this, the user must type in "remove" with nothing else following.
  If the current layer is an empty Optional, this command does nothing.
  - e.g. to remove the current layer (which is called "first"), the user would just
  type "remove"
    

- to quit the program, the user must type either "q" or "quit", both of 
which are case-insensitive.
